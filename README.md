## What is Ganz for?

chef Ganz is a cooking assistant that guides you through recipes and helps you decide what to eat. 

## How does it help you cook?

The assitant reads the recipe steps to the user, while also responding any questions and commands that may arise. For example, if you did not understand a step in the recipe, you can ask the assistant to repeat it. You can also ask questions related to the recipe or the ingredients in it.

## How does it suggest recipes to you?

When you first use the app, you will have a conversation with bumblebee to determine your eating preferences and nutritional goals. This is used to recommend recipes that will help you achieve your goals and taste good.
